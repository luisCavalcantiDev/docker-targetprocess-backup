# This script uses jq to parse JSON file which contains TargetProcess
# attachments metadata. jq documentation is at:
# http://xmodulo.com/how-to-parse-json-string-via-command-line-on-linux.html
# To see .json file pretty formatted and colored:
# cat $ATTACHMENTS_JSON | ./jq '.'
# After parsing the file, the TargetProcess attachments are downloaded.
# I discovered, there is no password or user needed for files download, but
# I provide them for the sake that it may be changed in the future.
